# 17990-analytics-recently-added-videos
In this sample, you will learn how to get Analytics data for videos that have been added to Video Cloud over some recent period (which you define in the inputs). Note that this app only returns reports on a single dimension, though it could be modified to report on multiple dimensions.

This repository contains all the code for your convenience:

<table>
	<thead>
		<th>File</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</thead>
	<tr>
		<td>index.html</td>
		<td>The sample as working HTML page</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>css/styles.css</td>
		<td>CSS used in the sample</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>js/index.js</td>
		<td>JavaScript used in the sample</td>
	</tr>
</table>
